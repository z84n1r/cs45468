A video essay uses audiovisual media to   present   a   cohesive   argument.   It   can feature   a combination of video and still images and   is   usually   paired with voice-over   or   written commentary. You can concentrate your analysis on a   specific   scene   or sequence or explore broader themes and patterns that   span   each   of your films.
MARKING CRITERIA
Your project will be marked   according   to   the following   criteria:
●         Engagement with   key concepts
●         Clarity   of   argument
●         Structure   and   flow   of   work
●         Engaging   presentation
●         Creative   use   of   media
●       Synthesis   of   creative   +   critical   elements
Please   note that this assignment does   NOT require extensive technical   ability   or   elaborate   presentation. You   still can use relatively simple   means   to   engage with   the   key concepts.
We expect to see evidence of substantial engagement with the course   content   (including   ideas covered   in the lectures, seminars and   readings), with at   least   ONE academic reference. References to the readings   should   be   included   as   'credits'at   the   end   of   your   video   essay   (Option   1), or   in   a   'works   cited'   section   at   the   end   of   your critical   reflection   (Option   2).
SUBMITTING YOUR WORK
Depending on the   kind of project you   have created,   there   are   different   options   for   submitting your work:
1.    Video   essay: simply   upload   the   media   file   (.mp4).
2.      Multimedia   narrative:   if your project   has generated a standalone media file   (.mp4,   .html,   .jpg,   .pdf, etc), then   upload   this, followed   by   your   critical   reflection   as   a   separate   file   (.docx,   .pdf, etc);   if   you   have   posted   your   project online, then   upload   the   critical   reflection   as   a   single   file   (.docx,   .pdf,   etc),   including the   URL for your creative project within the critical   reflection.If you are   uncertain about any aspect of this submission   process,   please   let   us   know.
VIDEO   ESSAYS: ADDITIONAL   INFORMATION
Getting started:
●       See   How-To   Video   EssaysLinks   to   an   external   site.,   a   helpful   guide   by   Greer Fyfe and   Miriam   Ross, which   includes advice on   planning your video, gathering and editing footage, and recording   voiceover.
●       In   particular,   Fyfe and   Ross emphasize   the   importance   of   having   a   clear   argument (as you would in a written essay)   and   keeping   your   approach   simple and direct, at   least to   begin with.
Copyright:
●       It   is understood that   any   copying   undertaken   in   the   creation   of your video
essay   is for purposes of criticism, that your video essay is   intended   primarily for viewing within the context of the course, and that you will acknowledge the   creator/ director of any film works you copy.
●       As   such, your   video   essay   falls   within   New   Zealand   copyright   law’s   provisions for   fair   dealing. See  代 写Media: Hollywood and its Others Assignment1: VIDEO ESSAYProcessing
代做程序编程语言 the   Copyright   Act   1994, Section   42: Criticism,   review,   and   news   reporting   Links   to   an   external   site.   – ‘Fair   dealing   with   a   work   for          the   purposes of criticism or review, of that or another work   or of a   performance of a work, does   not infringe copyright   in the work   if such fair   dealing   is accompanied by a sufficient   acknowledgement’   .
Gathering material:
●       In   many   cases, you   may   be   able   to   find   sections   of   your   chosen   film   on
YouTubeLinks to an external site.. You can then   use online   video   extractors   (such as onlinevideoconverter.com, clipconverter.io or keepvid.ch) to download these sections in common file   formats.
●       If   you   have   access   to   a   DVD   drive,   the   open-source   software
HandbrakeLinks to an external site. can be   used   to   extract   video   clips.
●       You   may   also   choose   to   build   your   video   using   selected   still   images,   in   which       case you could use your computer’s ‘screen grab’ function or   seek   out   images   online and right-click/control-click to add them to your downloads folder.
Editing   material:
●       You are likely to   have access   to free   video   editing   software   on   your   computer,
such   as   Video   Editor   (Windows   10) or   iMovie   (Apple).   Alternatively,   you   may wish to use commercially available products   like Adobe   Premiere,   or free/cheap applications available online.
●       Focus on learning   the   basic   editing   functions within   your   available   software, but don’t worry about complicated techniques and transitions. The   main   point   of the exercise   is for you to build a clear and   cohesive   argument through   the      medium of video.
Adding commentary, titles and   music:
●       Audio commentary – you could use   a   microphone   to   capture   this,   or   simply   use the onboard microphone on your   phone   or   computer
●       Titles   – your   video   editing   software   will   allow   you   to   create   intertitles/   subtitles
●       Music   –   royalty-free   music   is   available   online   in   various   places,   including
SoundcloudLinks to an external site.   (in the search   menu,   select   ‘Tracks’, then   click   the   option   that   reads   ‘To   listen   to’ and   change   it   to   ‘To   modify   commercially’).   Please do   not overdo the use of music: the   primary   purpose   of   the exercise   is to critically examine your film text, not   to   create   a   music   video
